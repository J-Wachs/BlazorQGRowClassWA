# Blazor QuickGrid RowClass Workaround

In .NET 10, the Blazor QuickGrid component will have support for setting the CSS class dynamically for rows.

This gives you the posibility to e.g. set row color depending on the content of the row.

If your project is at .NET 7, 8 or 9 you can have the same functionality by using the workaround shown in this repo.

The project has been developed in .NET 9.

For all the details, please look at the source code for the Weather.razor component. Everything is explained in
comments.
